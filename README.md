Excel-to-DSC
============
Use the attached Excel file to create an EAD container list. The process supports creating controlled vocabularies, mixed-content elements (such as title, persname, emph elements, etc.), date elements with ISO-8601 date normalizations, and a hierarchy up to 12 levels deep.

To get started:

* enter a container list in the attached Excel file, following the examples provided (hiding any of the 52 columns that you won't need to utilize)
* save the Excel file as an "XML Spreadsheet 2003" document
* transform your XML with the "Excel-to-DSC" XSLT style sheet
